# Telegram 2.0

Telegram 2.0 is an exciting and innovative project that aims to recreate the functionality of the original Telegram platform in a web-based environment. Using modern web technologies, this project offers users a seamless and familiar Telegram experience with a number of impressive features.

# Technology stack:

Telegram 2.0 uses a powerful and robust technology stack to deliver its features:

Client-side implementation: The client side of Telegram 2.0 is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. TypeScript extends the code base by adding robust typing and error checking to ensure a reliable user experience.

Server framework: The server side is built using the Django Rest Framework, a versatile web framework for Python. This choice ensures scalability, security, and efficient data processing.

# Main features:

Variety of messages: Users can send various types of messages, including text, images, videos, and files, all in real time. This versatility ensures that communication remains dynamic and engaging.

Search: Telegram 2.0 offers a search feature that allows users to easily find both other users and specific messages in chats. This ensures that no important information is lost in the conversation history.

Message status indicators: Message status indicators provide real-time feedback. Two check marks change color to indicate when a message was sent (white) and when it was read (blue), increasing transparency in communication.

Unread message counter: The unread message counter is displayed on the left panel of the site, in each chat block, so that users are promptly notified of new messages in their chats. This feature improves the overall user experience by facilitating timely responses to messages.

Message management: Users can edit and delete messages, giving them control over the content of the conversation. This feature is valuable for maintaining clear and accurate communication.

Online status: The app displays the online status of users and provides information about when they were last active. This feature facilitates real-time interaction by informing users about the availability of their contacts.

Settings panel: The settings panel contains various options and features, offering users a personalized experience according to their preferences.

Security: Telegram 2.0 prioritizes security through JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication. This ensures that user data remains secure and authorized requests to the server maintain data integrity.

Organization of messages: Messages are intelligently organized by date, allowing users to easily navigate through their conversation history and find specific information.

Sorting chats: Chats in the left pane are sorted from newest to oldest messages, which simplifies the user experience and provides quick access to the most recent conversations.

Telegram 2.0 is an impressive project that recreates the functionality of the popular messenger, while using modern web technologies. Its features ensure uninterrupted and efficient communication, making it an outstanding project in the field of web-based messaging platforms.
